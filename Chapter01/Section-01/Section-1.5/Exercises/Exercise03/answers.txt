Compare and contrast the loops that used a for with those using a while.
Are there advantages or disadvantages to using either form?

A for loop has advantages when it comes to iterating over a specific amount
or known value. It has built in iterator variables which is nice.

A while loop can have advantages when the amount of loops is unknown, like when
letting a user determine when a loop ends.
