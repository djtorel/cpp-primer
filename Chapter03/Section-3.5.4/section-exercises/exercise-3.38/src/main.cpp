/**
 * Exercise 3.38: In this section, we noted that it was not only illegal but
 * meaningless to try to add two pointers. Why would adding two pointers be
 * meaningless?
 *
 * A: A pointer is an address in memory. Adding two addresses would have almost
 * no use, as there isn't a real scenerio where that would return a predictable
 * address that could be used.
